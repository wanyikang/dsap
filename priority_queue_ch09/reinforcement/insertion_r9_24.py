# Describe a sequence of n insertions in a heap that requires Ω(nlogn) time to
# process.
#
# That means every insertion needs Ω(logn) time, so that all n sequence need
# Ω(nlogn) time. And That means every insertion is the minimum element in the
# heap. So we can list a sequence like the following:
# [5,4,3,2,1,0]
